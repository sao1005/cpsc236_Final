This is a variation on the game dots and boxes. Two players take turns placing lines on the grid to form a complete box. When a player completes a box, they get to mark the box and get a point. The person with the most complete boxes at the end wins.

The game is typically played on a square grid. We offset the grid to create parallelogram shaped boxes instead. The parallelograms alternate direction with each row. This required changing many of the drawing functions.
In addition, we changed the color scheme because the original color scheme was rather bright.
